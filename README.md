 
## Introduction      
This application is a simple implementation of the popular images feature of 500px which using the [500px API](https://github.com/500px/legacy-api-documentation) built using modern Android development strategies focusing on the following key aspects:     
- Code structuring as per clean Architecture      
- Using MVVM/MVI Pattern as per Google's recommendation      
- Android Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel, Navigation)        
- Kotlin features (Lambdas, Extension functions, typealias, sealed class and Coroutines)        
    
## App Overview      
 The app features single screen navigation      
      
- List screen displaying popular movies List
